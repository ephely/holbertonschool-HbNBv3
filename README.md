In this part of the HBnB Project, you will begin the implementation phase of the application based on the design developed in the previous part. The focus of this phase is to build the Presentation and Business Logic layers of the application using Python and Flask. You will implement the core functionality by defining the necessary classes, methods, and endpoints that will serve as the foundation for the application’s operation.

In this part, you will create the structure of the project, develop the classes that define the business logic, and implement the API endpoints. The goal is to bring the documented architecture to life by setting up the key functionalities, such as creating and managing users, places, reviews, and amenities, while adhering to best practices in API design.

It’s important to note that, at this stage, you will focus only on implementing the core functionality of the API. JWT authentication and role-based access control will be addressed in the next part. The services layer will be built using Flask and the flask-restx extension to create RESTful APIs.
